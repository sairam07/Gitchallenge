### Code challenge

I tried to implement as much as possible in given time. I faced an issue during authentication. I tried to implement basic authentication by passing 
values in headers but git requires Oauth which is new for me and based on exchanging tokens. I researched it on web but i couldn't 
figure it out with clarity.

I am submitting what i had done.
